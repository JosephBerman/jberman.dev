## FPGA Injection

### Injecting faulty CRC checks into signals serial communication

My self-directed final project for EECE7390 Computer Hardware Security at Northeastern University.

This proof of concept was to show the usability of injecting data into a serial stream with a FPGA. Due to how FPGA can handle incredible speeds itâ€™s possible to read data and inject a faulty value without the host system recognizing it.

In the end, only simulations of the conditions were successful.
